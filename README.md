## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>.git
   cd <your-repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preprocessing

Run the preprocessing script to prepare your datasets:

```bash
python3 data/pre_process.py
```

This script will load raw data, filter it, and generate processed files that will be used for training and evaluation.

---

## Training

To train the model, simply run:

```bash
python3 train.py
```

This command will:
- Load the processed dataset
- Initialize and train your model
- Print logs showing training progress and metrics
